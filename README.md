# git-rekt
A repository to which I commit all the bizzare Git states I've encountered.

Add Master Nonsense: Initial commit to master (edited on master).
Add Master Nonsense: Second line added to master.
Add Master Nonsense: Initial commit to branchA.
Add Master Nonsense: Second line(also from branchA).
Just using BranchB, forget the rest.
